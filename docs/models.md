CyPose supports a variety of models, including external CellPose and Omnipose models, as well as our fine-tuned models. By default, these models are included in the `models` directory at the root of this repository.

We provide the following custom models:

* [cypose-7002](https://github.com/cameronlab/cypose/blob/master/models/7002/cypose-7002) - Model for segmentation of PCC 7002.
* [cypose-7002-scratch](https://github.com/cameronlab/cypose/blob/master/models/7002/cypose-7002-scratch) - Model for segmentation of PCC 7002, trained from scratch.
* [cypose-33047](https://github.com/cameronlab/cypose/blob/master/models/33047/cypose-33047) - Model to segment Anabaena 33047.
